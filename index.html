        <h1>Movements</h1>
        <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size: 20px;">
            The sonata consists of three movements: Adagio sostenuto, Allegretto and Presto agitato. </br>
            <strong>Adagio sostenuto</strong> </br>
            The first movement, in C♯ minor and alla breve, is written in modified sonata-allegro form. Donald
            Francis Tovey warned players of this movement to avoid "taking [it] on a quaver standard like a slow 12
            8".</br>

            The movement opens with an octave in the left hand and a triplet figuration in the right. A melody that
            Hector Berlioz called a "lamentation",[citation needed] mostly by the left hand, is played against an
            accompanying ostinato triplet rhythm, simultaneously played by the right hand. The movement is played
            pianissimo (pp) or "very quietly", and the loudest it gets is piano (p) or "quietly". </br>

            The adagio sostenuto tempo has made a powerful impression on many listeners; for instance, Berlioz commented
            that it "is one of those poems that human language does not know how to qualify". Beethoven's student Carl
            Czerny called it "a nocturnal scene, in which a mournful ghostly voice sounds from the distance". The
            movement was very popular in Beethoven's day, to the point of exasperating the composer himself, who
            remarked to Czerny, "Surely I've written better things". </br>

            In his book Beethoven's pianoforte sonatas, the renowned pianist Edwin Fischer suggests that this movement
            of this sonata is based on Mozart's "Ah Soccorso! Son Tradito" of his opera Don Giovanni, which comes just
            after the Commendatore's murder. He claims to have found, in the archives of the Wiener Musikverein, a
            sketch in Beethoven's handwriting of a few lines of Mozart's music (which bears the same characteristic
            triplet figuration) transposed to C♯ minor, the key of the sonata. "In any case, there is no romantic
            moon-light in this movement: it is rather a solemn dirge", writes Fischer.
